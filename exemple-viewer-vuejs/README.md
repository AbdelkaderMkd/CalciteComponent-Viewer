# CalciteComponent-Viewer

This template demonstrates how to display an ArcGIS Web Map with Widgets (Bookmarks, BasemapGallery, LayerList, Legend, Print) using [Calcite Component design](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/).  
It's an adaptation of a specific [example](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/tutorials/create-a-mapping-app/), but utilizing the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework.  

The purpose of this repository:  
This template serves as a foundation for creating a custom ArcGIS web map viewer. It aligns with the design of the ArcGIS Map Viewer, leveraging the ArcGIS Calcite component design. The use of Vue.js is based on its compatibility with the ArcGIS components, design philosophy, and overall integration. It offers scalability and ease of maintenance, making it an ideal choice for this project.
